## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer whoâ€™s passionate about automation, cloud infrastructure, and writing clean, 
reliable code that actually makes developersâ€™ lives âœ¨ _easier_ âœ¨.

I work mainly with **Python** and **Microsoft Azure**, building scalable solutions, designing robust CI/CD pipelines, 
and making sure apps run smoothly from dev to production. 
Iâ€™m also pretty comfortable in the container worldâ€”*Docker, Kubernetes,* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using *Terraform,* 
and configuration management with *Ansible*. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and automated cloud environments 
that support modern development workflows and business needs.

ðŸ”§ My expertise spans:

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ARM templates)

- CI/CD using GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and Jenkins

- Azure services: App Services, AKS, Functions, Azure Monitor

- Containerization with Docker & orchestration via Kubernetes

- Writing clean, reusable Python code for automation and tooling

- Monitoring, logging, and improving system performance
    
This space is where I showcase some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, tools Iâ€™ve built. I thrive in collaborative environments and focus on building efficient, secure, and scalable systems. 

Letâ€™s build cool stuff. ðŸš€
