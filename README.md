## Hi there 👋

I’m a DevOps Engineer who’s passionate about automation, cloud infrastructure, and writing clean, reliable code that actually makes developers’ lives easier.

I work mainly with Python and Microsoft Azure, building scalable solutions, designing robust CI/CD pipelines, and making sure apps run smoothly from dev to production. I’m also pretty comfortable in the container world—Docker, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, and configuration management with Ansible. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and automated cloud environments that support modern development workflows and business needs.
Some things I enjoy:

    Automating everything (because why not?)

    Making infra-as-code actually readable

    Debugging weird issues at 2 AM (okay, maybe “enjoy” is a stretch)

    Learning new tools and sharing what I learn

This space is where I showcase some of the projects I’ve worked on, tools I’ve built, and the occasional experiment that spiraled into a full-blown side project. Always up for collaborating, learning, or geeking out over new tech.

Let’s build cool stuff. 🚀
