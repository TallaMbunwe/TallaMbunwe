## Hi there 👋

I’m a DevOps Engineer who’s passion about automation, cloud infrastructure, and writing clean, 
reliable code that actually makes developers’ lives ✨ _easier_ ✨.

I work mainly with **Python** and **Microsoft Azure**, building scalable solutions, designing robust CI/CD pipelines, 
and making sure apps run smoothly from dev to production. 

I’m also pretty comfortable in the container world—**Docker, Kubernetes,** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using **Terraform,** 
and configuration management with **Ansible**. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and automated cloud environments 
that support modern development workflows and business needs.

🔧 My expertise spans:

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, ARM templates)

- CI/CD using GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and Jenkins

- Azure services: App Services, AKS, Functions, Azure Monitor

- Containerization with Docker & orchestration via Kubernetes

- Writing clean, reusable Python code for automation and tooling

- Monitoring, logging, and improving system performance
    
This space is where I showcase some of the projects I’ve worked on, tools I’ve built. I thrive in collaborative environments and focus on building efficient, secure, and scalable systems. 

Let’s build cool stuff. 🚀
